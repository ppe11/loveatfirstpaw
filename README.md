## Installation Instructions

### 1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
- **Windows:** Open the **Command Prompt** (search for `cmd` in the Start Menu).
- **MacOS & Linux:** Open the **Terminal** (search for it in Spotlight or Applications > Utilities).

### 2. Clone the repository
   - Copy and paste the following command:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/CMPT-276-SPRING-2025/final-project-08-oceans.git
     cd final-project-08-oceans
     ```

### 3. Install dependencies
   - In the same terminal window, run:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```

### 4. Set up environment variables
   - Inside the project folder, create a file named `.env`.
   - For Petfinder, you will need a key and a secret, which can be aquired [here](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/).
   - For Mapbox, you will need a token, which can be aquired [here](https://www.mapbox.com/).
   - Copy and paste the items below into the .env file, replacing KEY and SECRET with the keys and secret you aquired from above (remove <> as well).
     ```sh
     PETFINDER_KEY = <KEY>
     PETFINDER_SECRET = <SECRET>
     MAPBOX_KEY = <KEY>
     ```

### 5. Run the development server
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

### 6. Open in browser
   - Open a web browser and go to:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000
     ```
   - The website should now be running locally.

## Additional Notes
- If you encounter permission errors on Linux while trying to run either npm install or npm run dev, you may need to run:
  ```sh
  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
  ```
  inside the project directory first, this will give you full control over the files and should fix the permission error.
